# Ad-Hoc_Insights

# Company: AtliQ Hardwares

AtliQ Hardwares (imaginary company), a leading computer hardware manufacturer based in India, operates on a global scale. Driven by a commitment to innovation, the company leverages data analytics to fuel smarter, data-driven decisions, empowering growth and success worldwide.
# Challenge
The Management Team of AtliQ noticed that they _do not get enough insights_ to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills.

# Task:  
As a hypothetical applicant for this role, I was tasked with:

1.    Check ‚Äòad-hoc-requests.pdf‚Äô - there are 10 ad hoc requests for which the business needs insights.
2.    You need to run a SQL query to answer these requests. 
3.    The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management - hence you need to create a presentation to show the insights.

# My Approach
1. **Data Extraction with SQL:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utilized _MySQL_ to run queries and pull the necessary data.  

2. **Data Visualization:**  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leveraged _Power BI_ to visualize the output, making the insights clear and compelling.  

3. **Presentation Design:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Designed an engaging and professional presentation in _Canva_ to effectively communicate the insights.  

4. **Actionable Insights:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided actionable insights and recommendations to assist the management team in making informed 

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decisions.
